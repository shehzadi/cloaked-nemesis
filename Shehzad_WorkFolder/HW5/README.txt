Instructions for running Q6

I have provided readckt.o, readckt.c, readckt, and Makefile

try running readckt on unix command line

If the prompt changes to command> then the program is working if not, run make.

once the program is running and you see a prompt for command> you can type READ filename.ckt to read a circuit file

if the file is read properly you will see an OK message

Then you can send  command of PC to see the list of nodes and their fin fout etc

In order to run my code you will have to run the command LEV on the command prompt

At that point you will see all the levels assigned to every node and then the program will also print out a sorted list of nodes in ascending order of level values. 
The additional code added for this HW can be triggered by typing logic on the command prompt. 5 input vectors and their corresponding outputs are displayed on the console.
